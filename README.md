# Flutter Boilerplate with NodeJS and MongoDB

This is a boilerplate for starting a flutter project with the connectivity of nodejs(JWT token included) and mongoDB. 
For flutter I have used provider and shared preference to store and manage the user data.

## Getting Started

 Start the project with following steps: <br>
i. <code>npm install </code> <br>
ii. <code> npm i nodemon </code>

You can also update shared preference and provider package.
